Kenworth Truck Company has decided that certain Vehicle Model Year 2023-2026 T180 / T280 / T380 / T480 chassis built from 7/5/2022 through 12/20/2024 fail to conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 101, Controls and Displays and No. 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment.
The Exterior Lighting Switch (ELS) in certain vehicles may not function. It is non-responsive and can be reset only by a key cycle. If the ELS fails, the hazard lights and the backlight brightness adjustment may not function. As a result, the lack of hazard lights may not alert other drivers. Failure to adjust the backlight brightness may distract the operator or make it difficult to see critical safety information, which may increase the risk of a crash. No warning precedes this condition.
Kenworth has initiated a recall to update vehicle software. This repair should take approximately 1 hour and will be performed at no charge to you. Please contact your Kenworth dealer immediately to schedule an appointment for this repair. You can find your nearest Kenworth dealer using the Dealer Locator on our website www.Kenworth.com or by scanning the QR code on this letter."

Nissan will notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it is issuing a Voluntary Safety Recall Campaign on certain model year 2025 Nissan Sentra vehicles identified in Service Comm and DBS National Service History.
On affected vehicles, potential improper weld penetration between the lower seat frame and bracket may result in excessive free play movement of the drivers seat and may not meet the requirements of FMVSS 207 S4.2.1 Seat Adjustment, FMVSS 207 S4.3.2 Performance of Restraining Device, and FMVSS 210 S5.1 Seats with Type 1 or Type 2 Seat Belt Assemblies.
The Nissan dealer will inspect the driver seat track and, if necessary, replace the lower seat frame assembly."

2025 SENTRA; DRIVER SEAT TRACK INSPECTION
INTRODUCTION
Nissan is conducting this voluntary safety recall campaign on certain specific model year
2025 Sentra vehicles to inspect the driver seat track. This service will be performed at no
charge to the customer for parts or labor.
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
Nissan has assigned identification number PMA45 to this campaign. This number must
appear on all communication and documentation of any nature dealing with this campaign.
DEALER RESPONSIBILITY
It is the dealers responsibility to check Service COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS)
National Service History for the campaign status on each vehicle falling within the range of
this voluntary safety recall which for any reason enters the service department. This
includes vehicles purchased from private parties or presented by transient (tourist) owners
and vehicles in a dealers inventory. Federal law requires that new vehicles in dealer
inventory which are the subject of a safety recall must be corrected prior to sale.
Failure to do so can result in civil penalties by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. While federal law applies only to new vehicles, Nissan strongly
encourages dealers to correct any used vehicles in their inventory before they are retailed."

What is the problem?
Over time and continuous use, the trailer hitch assembly bolts may loosen due to improper torque (tightening) during installation, potentially causing the assembly to separate from the vehicle body during towing or normal driving conditions. If the fastening bolts are not sufficiently tightened, they may fail to secure the trailer hitch assembly properly, resulting in it becoming loose or detached.

Infiniti has assigned identification number PD138 to this campaign. This number must

RETAILER RESPONSIBILITY
It is the retailers responsibility to check Service COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS)
National Service History for the campaign status on each vehicle falling within the range of
this voluntary safety recall which for any reason enters the service department. This
includes vehicles purchased from private parties or presented by transient (tourist) clients
and vehicles in a retailers inventory. Federal law requires that new vehicles in retailer
inventory which are the subject of a safety recall must be corrected prior to sale.
Failure to do so can result in civil penalties by the National Highway Traffic Safety

INFINITI is committed to the safety and security of our clients and their passengers. INFINITI has notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it is issuing Voluntary Safety Recall Campaigns on certain model year 2025 INFINITI QX60 vehicles identified in Service Comm and DBS National Service History.
On affected vehicles, one or both front brake calipers may have reduced strength and could potentially break. If either of the front brake calipers fail and separate from the front brake assembly, it can result in reduced braking performance. If this occurs, the condition may not be compliant with certain performance requirements of FMVSS 135 Light vehicle brake systems.
Retailers will inspect both front brake calipers by lot code. If the lot code is determined to be suspect, the affected front brake caliper(s) will be replaced with a new one."

Nissan is committed to the safety and security of our customers and passengers. Nissan has notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it is conducting a Voluntary Safety Recall Campaign on certain model year 2025 Nissan Kicks vehicles identified in Service Comm and DBS National Service History.
On affected vehicles, the Certification Label may have been printed with the incorrect Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) values. To remedy a potential noncompliance with US regulation CFR 49 Part 567.4, corrected labels have been created for installation on affected vehicles.
Dealers will receive a VIN list for the affected inventory vehicles. Additionally, dealers will receive the corrected certification labels via UPS for each vehicle in dealer inventory the week of March 31, 2025.
Owners of potentially affected retailed vehicles will receive corrected certification labels in May, 2025, along with instructions on how to install the new label. Alternatively, owners can take the corrected certification label to any Nissan dealer of their choice to have the remedy completed."

INTRODUCTION
Nissan is conducting this voluntary recall campaign on certain specific model year 2025 Kicks vehicles that the Certification Label may have potentially been printed with the incorrect Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) values. To remedy this issue, Nissan is providing customers with a new Certification Label. Customers have the option of affixing the new Certification Label or going to a Nissan dealership to have the new label affixed at no charge for parts or labor.
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
Nissan has assigned identification number PD136 to this campaign. This number must appear on all communication and documentation of any nature dealing with this campaign.
DEALER RESPONSIBILITY
It is the dealers responsibility to check Service COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS) National Service History for the campaign status on each vehicle falling within the range of this voluntary recall which for any reason enters the service department. This includes vehicles purchased from private parties or presented by transient (tourist) owners and vehicles in a dealers inventory. Federal law requires that new vehicles in dealer inventory which are the subject of a recall must be corrected prior to sale. Failure to do so can result in civil penalties by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. While federal law applies only to new vehicles, Nissan strongly encourages dealers to correct any used vehicles in their inventory before they are retailed."
